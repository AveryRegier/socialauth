#summary How to run your application on localhost .

If you want to test your application on localhost, following are the steps to make it possible:-
  # Get your consumer keys and secrets by registering with providers. For more info read [GettingStarted GettingStarted]
  # Open hosts file from “C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc” path.
  # Make entry in hosts file as below:-
{{{
# Copyright (c) 1993-1999 Microsoft Corp.
#
# This is a sample HOSTS file used by Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows.
#
# This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to host names. Each
# entry should be kept on an individual line. The IP address should
# be placed in the first column followed by the corresponding host name.
# The IP address and the host name should be separated by at least one
# space.
#
# Additionally, comments (such as these) may be inserted on individual
# lines or following the machine name denoted by a '#' symbol.
#
# For example:
#
#      102.54.94.97     rhino.acme.com          # source server
#       38.25.63.10     x.acme.com              # x client host

127.0.0.1	opensource.brickred.com 
#Here opensource.brickred.com can be your domain name.
#127.0.0.1       localhost
}}}
  # Change your server name from localhost to “opensource.brickred.com” or your domain name.
  # Run your server on port 80.
  # Deploy your application and start your server. Now you can access your application by using "http://opensource.brickred.com/myapp"
